# E-commerce-website
A simple Java-based eCommerce web application designed to meet basic shopping needs. Built using Servlets, JSP, and JDBC to manage products, users, and orders. This project was developed as part of my academic learning to implement core Java web development concepts like MVC architecture, database connectivity, and form handling.
